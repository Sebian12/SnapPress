# Changelog

## v1.10.5

### Maintenance
- Extracted duplicated `resource_path()` from `main.py` and `settings.py` into a shared `utils.py`
- Added `save_settings()` helper in `settings.py` to replace repeated `config.save_config(...)` calls with all five arguments
- Renamed `b_mode` to `appearance_mode` for naming consistency
- Renamed `qualityLbl` to `quality_lbl` to match snake_case convention used elsewhere
- Documented ERROR0x/WARNING0x numbering scheme
- Split `compress()` into `lock_ui()`, `unlock_ui()`, and `compress_single_file()` for readability

### Improvements
- `WARNING01` (no output folder set) is now a Yes/No confirmation instead of a plain info message; declining aborts the compression with a dedicated messagebox
- Completion summary now notes when files were saved next to the originals because no output folder was set

## v1.10.4

### Bugfixes
- Settings button and photo drop area are now disabled while a compression batch is running, preventing settings or file list changes from producing inconsistent results mid-batch

### Reverted
- Reverted an attempt to scope the Settings window's "always on top" behavior to just the main window instead of the whole desktop — caused display issues, so the previous behavior was restored

### Improvements
- Version label at the bottom of the main window is now a muted gray instead of full-brightness text
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` to track release history directly in the repo
- Various README.md updates

## v1.10.3

### Features
- Added app logo to the settings window
- Added version label to the bottom of the main window

## v1.10.2

### Bugfixes
- Fixed `preserve_exif` setting having no effect on compression — EXIF metadata (including GPS) was preserved regardless of the "Preserve EXIF metadata" toggle, and `remove_gps` stayed enabled internally after disabling EXIF preservation
- Fixed compressed files silently overwriting each other when two selected files had the same name but came from different folders
- Fixed unhandled exception crashing the whole batch when a file failed to save — output folder is now validated before compression starts
- Fixed file list and buttons staying interactive during compression, which could cause files to be silently skipped if the list changed mid-run
- Fixed orphaned frame widget left in memory when a thumbnail failed to load
- Fixed `save_config()` crashing on write errors instead of failing gracefully

## v1.10.1

### Features
- Changed app logo
- Updated README.md

### Known limitations
- Logo might not be visible while using dark mode
- Logo doesn't show when downloading. Creating a copy or a shortcut to the app changes the logo

## v1.10.0

### Features
- Added "Preserve EXIF metadata" toggle in settings
- Added "Remove GPS data" checkbox in settings (active only when EXIF preservation is enabled)
- GPS tag (34853) is now stripped from compressed JPG when "Remove GPS data" is enabled

### Bugfixes
- Fixed `FileNotFoundError` — `os.path.getsize()` was called before the `os.path.exists()` check
- Fixed `before_space_lbl` and `after_space_lbl` not resetting when clearing the list
- Fixed `preserve_exif` and `remove_gps` not being restored from config on app startup
- Fixed thumbnail size slider not restoring saved value on settings open (`thumb_size` saved as float, now cast to int)

### Known limitations
- EXIF metadata preservation not supported for PNG files

### Notes
- This and the next release (1.11.0) won't contain native Ubuntu-based or Fedora Linux binaries
- Mid patches like 1.x.1 etc. won't be released as Linux binaries

## v1.9.0

### Features
- EXIF metadata preservation for JPG/JPEG files during compression
- File picker and output folder dialog now start from `/home` on Linux instead of `/` for better UX

### Bugfixes
- Fixed missing `f` prefix in WARNING02 message — `{skipped}` was not interpolated
- Fixed `.jpg`/`.jpeg` files not visible in file picker on Linux — "All Files" is now the default filter on Linux

### Known limitations
- EXIF metadata preservation not supported for PNG files

## v1.8.6

### Features
- Replaced tkinter messagebox with CTkMessagebox — dialogs now follow the app theme (dark/light mode)

### Maintenance
- Updated screenshots in `assets/`
- Updated README — added CTkMessagebox and customtkinter to Requirements and Installation sections

## v1.8.5

### Bugfixes
- Fixed memory leak in `remove_file()` — `thumbnail_refs` was not cleared when removing a single file
- Fixed `settings_win == None` changed to `settings_win is None` (proper Python `None` comparison)
- Fixed `app` parameter in `show_settings()` renamed to `root` to avoid shadowing outer scope variable
- Fixed `icon_img` garbage collection issue on Linux — stored as `app.icon_img` to prevent premature cleanup
- Fixed `TypeError: open_settings() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given`

## v1.8.4

### Features
- Added native Linux binary for Fedora Linux

### Notes
- App icon works correctly on Fedora Linux

## v1.8.3

### Bugfixes — Linux
- Fixed `ImportError: PIL.Image and PIL.ImageTk couldn't be imported` in compiled Linux binary — added `--hidden-import PIL._tkinter_finder` and `--hidden-import PIL.ImageTk` to the PyInstaller build command
- Removed broken app icon (`iconphoto`) on Linux causing `_tkinter.TclError: not a photo image` on startup

### Bugfixes — Windows
- Fixed settings window closing unexpectedly when toggling dark/light mode (removed `transient()` + `WM_DELETE_WINDOW` combination causing conflict with customtkinter theme rebuild)

### Maintenance
- Removed redundant `if/else: pass` blocks in `compress()`

### Known limitations — Linux
- Output folder dialog may appear behind the settings window (`-topmost` removed alongside `transient`)
- App icon is not displayed on Linux (removed due to `PhotoImage`/`iconphoto` incompatibility, root cause not yet identified)

## v1.8.2 (Linux only)

### Bugfixes
- Fixed `ImportError: PIL.Image and PIL.ImageTk couldn't be imported` in compiled Linux binary

### Other
- Added screenshots from the Linux app

## v1.8.1

### Features
- Added native Linux binary (built and tested on Zorin OS 18.1, Ubuntu-based)
- Cross-platform icon handling: `.ico` on Windows via `iconbitmap`, `.png` on Linux via `iconphoto`

### Bugfixes
- Fixed settings window appearing behind the output folder dialog (`transient(app)` instead of `topmost`)

### Maintenance
- Updated `.gitignore`
- Updated README with Linux installation instructions and a Native Linux Support section

### Known limitations
- Linux binary may not work on distributions with an older glibc version or on non-glibc systems (e.g. Alpine)
- May have issues on pure Wayland sessions without XWayland
- App icon does not appear in dock/launcher on Linux (requires a `.desktop` file, not yet implemented)

### Bugfixes
- Fixed `config.json` path resolution after compiling to `.exe`
- Added `WM_DELETE_WINDOW` handler in settings window to ensure config is saved on close

## v1.7.3

### Bugfixes
- Fixed `KeyError: 'thumb_size'` when loading old or missing `config.json`
- Fixed `UnboundLocalError` in `load_config()` — `json.load()` was called outside the `with` block
